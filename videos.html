      <h2><strong>Director’s Note from 2013: It's Complicated</strong></h2>
      <p>Anonymity in the virtual space comes with no responsibility attached to it. One may comment or now even submit anonymous secrets without any consequences beyond the screen. Anonymity in Show Some Skin contrasts to this. The process of Show Some Skin requires an underlying level of courage for the writers to submit their monologues due to the fact that these stories become the center of discourse for the production. The anonymous writers behind the stories have a spectrum of attitudes and understanding—stories are not neatly packaged. Each year, the anonymous writers push the boundaries of the production further. They show us the unexplored paths for our production.</p>
      <p>After last year’s production, many audience members were confused that the actors on stage were not the writers of the monologues. The actors are leaders who come from various niches of our Notre Dame community. They stepped up to fill in the shoes of the anonymous writers. Rehearsals center on pushing ourselves to consider all possible interpretations and to build up characters with complex dimensions. We will never know what the authors truly wanted to convey. The actors now stand on stage in front of you, despite their own fears and disagreements and sometimes personal hesitations about the monologues. Much sleep was lost on our attempt at representing the people behind anonymity.</p>
	  <p>We hope the production to be an ever evolving group that questions the dominant narrative at any given moment in time. Wherever this takes us, we hope to open up the discourse to be inclusive of the marginal voices. -E. Cho</p>

	    <h2><strong>Director’s Note from 2012: The Race Monologues</strong></h2>

		<p>Dear Friends,</p>
		<p>The actors on stage for this performance are not portraying their own experiences but searched their hearts to embody the monologues. Twenty one actors and three directors from various backgrounds came together to teach each other—snip bits of lessons ranged from definition of F.O.B. (‘fresh off the boat’ meaning immigrants or international students) to much more serious discussion on the usage of ‘wetbacks’, referring to undocumented migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
		<p>These stories do not always reflect the values of inclusion, multiculturalism, and anti-racism. and we struggled with this messy reality. Many of the writers showcased holding dual tensions--loving Notre Dame but hating the sometimes racially homophobic environment, embracing anti-racism but not knowing how to act by it, and so forth. These stories require in-depth reflections.</p>
		<p>We believe we have a hopeful message to share through this performance. People have shared their stories anonymously with the hope of being heard. People have come forth as actors with the hope of giving a voice for those who are rarely heard. Finally, you give us hope that our conversation will go beyond this production. The concepts of diversity, race, and multiculturalism do not belong to one person or one organization. We think everyone should be talking about it. This production was our effort to act. We can’t wait to see what you will do.</p>
		<p>Peace, Edithstein Cho</p>
