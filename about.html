			<h1>History</h1>
				<p class="lead">Show Some Skin started from “Asiatic Gaze,” a biweekly column circle made up of Edith Cho, JeeSeun Choi, and Hien Luu for the Observer. With a mission to dedicate many words to diversity, the writers felt the need to take more action on identity and race due to the lack of conversation about race relations at Notre Dame. 
				
				Countless supporters made the first year’s production to launch with a great success in March 2012. The first year Call for Stories brought over a hundred monologues from the ND community. The performance put on by twenty one actors was attended by over 700 audience members with a Full house for both shows. The Race Monologues revealed much complexity and ambivalence concerning race and intersecting categories of identity. This led to the expansion of the production’s theme in 2013: It’s Complicated. 
				
				The 2013 Call for Stories centered around the complexity of identity asking questions like, “What makes you complex? What's complicated about the intersections of the different facets of your self? What's complicated about your experiences with others?” This broader direction engaged issues of food stamps, body image, mental illnesses, etc. The second year was another huge success with three nights of Full House performances.
