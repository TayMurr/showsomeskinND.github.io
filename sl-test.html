			<h1>Call For Papers</h1>
			<p>Three years ago, Show Some Skin asked to hear your stories about race and racism and your responses changed us and the way we looked at Notre Dame. We saw that things were complicated, so we asked again and your voices shook us down to our core. We saw you be brave and your courage inspired us. This year, we challenged you to Be Bold and to raise your voices even louder so that your truths would be heard. Your realness and courage in taking a step forward and claiming your happiness and doubt, joy and fear, your hope and your insecurity, gave us the chance to reveal what you had shared with us in front of hundreds of your fellow students, faculty, and staff.</p>
			<p>The time has come again for us to ask to hear your stories. It has been three years and we know that we have only just scratched the surface. We don’t want to take shortcuts, we aren’t satisfied with surface exposure. We want the chance to truly see you, the darkness and the light. We want the chance to see all of who you are. Tell us more. </p>
			<p>When we look at something, it is tempting to allow ourselves to think we know it, that we know you, from that first look. We want to dig deeper, to push back against the gut reactions. We want to mature as a community to be able to elaborate, to explain, and to explore the complicated dynamics of our realities. For three years you have helped us to do that and now we are asking you to help us do it again. Tell us more!</p>
			<p>Tell us what your world looks like and what it is made of, what still sits at the front of your mind and what still hides at the back. Tell us what needs fixing and what is already beautiful. Tell us what you think/feel/wonder about. Tell us about the things we missed and the things we didn’t catch.  We cannot walk the straight and narrow. We want to walk the road less traveled and we want you to show us the way, to be our guides and to teach us how much we really haven’t seen, because we know that there is no way we’ve seen it all.</p>
			<p><strong>Tell us more!</strong></p>
			<p>We want to briefly share with you a few writing prompts that can serve as fodder, possible points of departure to get you thinking and writing. Your stories are not limited to the prompts below. Dig deeper and tell us more about your experiences. Not just who, what, when, and where--but remember to <strong>wonder why</strong>. This may take you to unexpected places, enrich and clarify your story in unexpected ways. </p>


			<p>Dig deeper into your personal history, family history, and all the things that surround you. </p>
			<p><ul>
			<li>What are you proud of?</li>
			<li>What is beautiful to you? About yourself? Your parents? Your background? Your culture?</li>
			<li>What are those flavors and smells and sounds and textures that you keep thinking about? that you miss?  that you want to share?</li>
			<li>What is your Notre Dame experience? What is Notre Dame, anyway? </li>
			<li>What are the consequences of some enduring Notre Dame traditions?</li>
			<li>What traditions do you feel included in or excluded from?</li>
			<li>What is it like to live out your race? </li>
			<li>What is your experience as an International student/Resident Alien/Immigrant?</li>
			<li>How do you interact with people who are similar to you compared to people you perceive as different?</li>
			<li>What traditions define you? What is beautiful about your cultural heritage? Are there traditions fun, strange, unique?</li>
			<li>Who do you surround yourself with? How have friendships and relationships with people of different backgrounds enhanced your life?</li>
			<li>How do you respond to being erased? What does the erasing? </li>
			<li>How has Notre Dame made you invisible? How have you made yourself visible?</li>
			<li>How has Notre Dame pushed you forward and given you space to showcase your colors?</li>
			<li>Have you ever had to stand up to friends? To professors? To yourself? </li>
			<li>Who do you want to protect at Notre Dame? </li>
			<li>Have you ever wished someone would stand to protect you?  </li>
			<li>Where, or with whom, do you feel happiest/safest/most yourself at Notre Dame? </li>
			<li>How do you celebrate being a part of Notre Dame? Why do you celebrate? Do you celebrate?</li>
			<li>How do you celebrate yourself?</li>
			<li>How should Notre Dame celebrate that you are a part of it?  </li>
			<li>What are you? Really, what are you rather than just what are you not?</li>
